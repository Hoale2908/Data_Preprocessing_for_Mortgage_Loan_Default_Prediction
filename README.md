The objective of this project is to preprocess a large dataset of mortgage loan applications to improve data quality and ensure the accuracy of the default prediction model. By handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data, the preprocessing phase sets the stage for effective modeling and analysis.

The dataset consists of approximately 150,000 mortgage loan applications submitted in 2019, containing 32 attributes. The attributes include demographic information, loan characteristics, and financial indicators relevant to mortgage defaults.

The dataset presented challenges such as missing values in certain attributes, outliers in income and loan amounts, and noisy data that required cleansing before it could be used for modeling.

I used data visualization tools such as boxplots, histogram, or heatmap to detect patterns in the data, visualize missing values, and spot outliers. These visualizations helped to inform decisions on data transformation and feature engineering.

After preprocessing, the dataset was free of missing values, outliers were handled appropriately, and noisy data was removed. The processed dataset is now well-prepared for feature extraction and model development.
